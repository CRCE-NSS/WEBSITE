When we listen, we are giving space to what is.”<br>— Richard Freeman.</b><br>On 10th of September 2020, NSS CRCE organised a workshop on Yoga with Dr. Kush Panchal. Dr. Kush Panchal is a Yoga and Fitness Trainer and has been the Personal Trainer of Celebrities like Kangana Ranaut, Emma Watson and Shahid Kapoor. The webinar started off by Dr. Kush teaching us a few stretching poses. He went on with Meditation and guided all the students during it. He also spoke about the various advantages of doing Meditation daily, like Increase in Concentration and less Stress and Anxiety. To make the session more engaging and fun, he also did Bhangra along with four NSS volunteers followed by a Q&A session wherein all volunteers discussed their various physique related issues.</p>

            <p style="text-align:center; font-size:17px;"><b>“Self-defence is not only our right; it is our duty.”- Ronald Reagan</b><br>On 7th October 2020, NSS CRCE organised a workshop on self-defense along with Sensei Kashyap Bhanushali. Sensei Kashyap started off with an amazing practical demonstration of various moves that can be employed to defend oneself in time of need. With the help of his younger brother, Sensei Kashyap showed how attackers approach the victims and also showed how we can defend ourselves even if one’s physical strength is way less than that of the attacker's. The webinar ended with a Q&A session where our volunteers got all their doubts cleared. The key take-away from the session was how we, as individuals, should be aware of the situations which possess a threat in order to defend ourselves.

Be it Bandra Fair Volunteering with Mumbai Police or Multiple Beach Clean-Ups. But this year due to the pandemic, our hand were tied and we were only able to host webinars on various awareness topics. That’s when we organized a virtual Recycle Fest. In Recycle Fest, all of our members were told to make something useful out of the waste lying around in their house. This waste could be anything like Plastic Bottle, CD’s, Shampoo Bottles, etc. We received an outstanding response from both our NSS Members and Non-Members, with over 40+ students submitting their ideas. We also had our Top – 15 who had performed wonderfully. Some of the Ideas included Vase from Plastic Bottles, Coffee Coaster, Plant Vase, Diwali Kandeel from Medicine Bottle and a lot more.</p>

The speaker for the webinar, Mr. TJ Preejo taught us the importance of self-love and self-care, we should be calm and positive while taking decisions or having an argument/discussion with someone, we should develop small hobbies like drawing, painting, dancing, etc. as an escape. Hence, anyone having any kind of problem should make sure that you connect with people. Practice meditation and journaling, it would help reduce stress and anxiety. Have a healthy diet and workout frequently. The session was ended with a very active Q&A session with our volunteers learning a lot about the importance of self-love while giving less priority toward the negative things in live.</p>

                On November 1st 2020, members of NSS CRCE in association with a start-up organization Paw-tectors formed by CRCE alumni’s, had gathered virtually to help people reflect on the vision and mission of Paw-tectors.This event was organized to address the need to protect and owning street dogs around. The speakers for the webinar Ms. Saylee Sawant and Mr. Saif Naqvi started off by sharing their vision and mission with us. Sayalee then addressed the need to adopt street dogs rather than full breed dogs supported by its pros and cons. Saif Naqvi then explained everyone some ways in which one can help street dogs which can be carried out individually but can make a huge difference for the dogs. Some of these ways included strapping on a reflective dog collar so they can be safe from passing vehicles around them and volunteering in affective ways by donating some essentials and spreading awareness for welfare of dogs starting from one’s own society. There was a Q&A session at the end. This session was truly an eye-opener for all and encouraged us all to be the voice for these animals and make this world a peaceful place for both humans and animals.</p>

Mandala Art is considered to be a great stress reliever. They help in increasing Concentration and make it easier to be mindful. Mandala pushes your thoughts aside and makes you think creatively. This helps a lot to people suffering from Depression, Anxiety and Stress. After that, she explained us all the patterns that are commonly used during Mandala Art Drawing. After all the theory, we all started drawing along with her. From creating concentric circles to drawing different shapes, this session was a lot fun and interactive at the same time. At the end of the session everyone was requested to send whatever work they had done. And the response which we got for that was mind blowing.</p>

The session aimed to educate young minds on how to be truthful to oneself and to others. The webinar was focused on ownership of one's acts either good or bad.Mr. Preejo certainly created an enthusiastic environment to say. He clearly talked about the behavioural pattern of individuals when it comes to ownership of one's own acts. The entire webinar was revolved around one thing, and that is ownership and goal setting. . The talk took about an hour and a half and the audience played an amazing role to make it a success.After successful completion of level 1 of the Boot Camp initiative, the focus was put on level 2.The entire webinar was revolved around one thing, and that is Truthfulness and Honesty. Because when one is truthful to one's own self, there are no regrets to ponder upon.NSS CRCE with The Movement India organized an event on Servant Leadership.Servant Leadership is a topic that not many people are aware about and that is why we kept this topic as the Level 3 of our Personality Development Sessions.The Speaker for this session was Mr. Preejo, who has over 11 years of Behavioural Training Experience.Before starting with the main topic, Preejo sir asked the members few questions from the Level 1 & 2. Members seemed to remember most part of the two sessions.Preejo sir then quickly revised whatever had been done in the Level 1 & 2 and then started off with What exactly is Servant Leadership according to the members?</p>
